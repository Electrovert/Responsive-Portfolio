                It is my hope to become a back-end developer one day.<br>
                The challange is rewarding, to the point that I enjoy<br>
                watching my code materalize. Like magic, it seems right<br>
                now. One day, I would like to have my own website, built<br>
                from scratch, that will provide a message to all that need<br>
                it. That need to know they are not alone.
            </p>

                My calling is to be an activist, and it's through the coding skills
                I am picking up right now that will allow me to reach as far as I'd like. <br> <br>
                I want to help everyone I can by getting to them where they're hiding in plain sight; on their devices.
            </p>
