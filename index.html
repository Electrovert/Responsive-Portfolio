      <p>It is my hope to become a back-end developer one day.</p>
        <p>The challange is rewarding, to the point that I enjoy watching my code materalize.</p> 
        <p>Like magic, it seems right now.</p> 
        <p>One day, I would like to have my own website, built from scratch, that will provide a message to all that need it.</p>
        <p>That need to know they are not alone.</p>
        <p>My calling is to be an activist, and it's through the coding skills I am picking up right now that will allow me to reach as far as I'd like.</p>
        <p>I want to help everyone I can by getting to them where they're hiding in plain sight; on their devices.</p>
